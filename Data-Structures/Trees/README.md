# Trees

## Challenge

- Create a Binary Tree class that follows a depth first approach to traversal. Include a preOrder, inOrder and postOrder method for traversal.

- Create a Binary Search Tree class that has a add method that accepts a value and adds a new node in the correct location along with a contains method that accepts a value and returns a boolean.
## Approach and Efficiency

- When preOrder() is applied the time efficiency is O(n) because you traverse each node once. The Space efficiency is O(1) as it retains no additional memory.

- When inOrder() is applied the time efficiency is O(n) because you traverse each node once. The Space efficiency is O(1) as it retains no additional memory.

- When postOrder() is applied the time efficiency is O(n) because you traverse each node once. The Space efficiency is O(1) as it retains no additional memory.

- When Add() is applied the time efficiency is O(n) because you traverse each node until the correct location is found to insert. The Space efficiency is O(1) as you will only add in one place each method call.
 
- When Contains() is applied the time efficiency is O(n) because you traverse each node once. The Space efficiency is O(1) as it retains no additional memory.

# Linked List

# Challenge

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the Next Node. The LinkedList class includes a head property. Upon instantiated an empty Linked List is created.

# Big O

- When Includes() is applied the time efficiency is O(n) as at most you would simply need to traverse the entire list. The space efficiency is O(1) as no additional memory is instantiated.

- When Insert() is applied the time efficiency is O(1) as regardless of the size of the list, the method will always insert this at the beginning node. In addition, the sspace efficiency is O(1) as no additional memory is instantiated. 

- When Append() is applied the time and efficiency is O(n) as you simply traverse the entire list to the end. The space efficiency is O(1) as you will always add to the same space regardless of the amount.

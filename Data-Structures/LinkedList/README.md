# Linked List

# Challenge

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the Next Node. The LinkedList class includes a head property. Upon instantiated an empty Linked List is created.

# Big O

- The time and space efficiency of the methods involved with the creation and insertion of the Linked List is O(n). Everything runs on a linear path as it traverses from node to node.

# Linked List Merge

# Challenge

- Given a variable two linked lists, zip them together where each node value is inserted one after another.

# Big O

- The time efficiency of this method is O(n) as you simply traverse the entirity of the list.

- The space efficiency is O(1) as we are not creating anything new.

# Insights

- I first determine the length of each and then make necessary calculations. The refence pointers are inconsisten when re-assigning and as such a Node placeholder for Current values in each list was essential.

### Insertion Sort

## Challenge

- Write a method for insertion sort that takes in an unsorted array and returns the sorted array using insertion sort.

## BIG O

- The time efficiency of this method is typically O(n^2) unless the array is already sorted, in which case it is O(n). The space efficiency is O(1) as we are not instantiating a new array.

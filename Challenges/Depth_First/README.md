# Depth First Graph Traversal

### Challenge

- Create a method that accepts an adjacency list as a graph and conducts a depth first traversal. Return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

### Big O

- The time efficiency of this method is O(n) as we will need to traverse through every node in the graph. The space efficiency of this method is O(n). We are utilizing a List ot hold the order of the Nodes and a stack to hold nodes which have potential children to yet visited.

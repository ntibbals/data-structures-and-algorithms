# Tree Intersection

## Challenge
- Write a method that accepts two binary trees and returns the matching pair values between the two trees.

## Approach and Efficiency
- The time efficiency of this method is O(n) because the method will touch every node within the tree.
- - The space efficiency of this method is O(H) for the height of the tree. This is because we are instantiating and new hash table that includes the entirety of the binary tree.

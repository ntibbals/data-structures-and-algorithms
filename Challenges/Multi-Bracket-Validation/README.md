# Multi Bracket Validation

# Challenge

- Create a method that takes a string as its only agrument and should return a boolean representing whether or not the backets in the string are balaned.
# Big O

- The time efficiency of this method is O(n). It utilizes a for loop to traverse the array and push and pop into a stack as needed.
- The space efficiency of this method is o(n). It does instantiate a new char array and stack as placeholders to run the validation. 
# Insights

- I utilized an altered node and stack class that rather than take in integers, leverages characters as "Values".

# Determine if a Binary Tree is Balanced

### Challenge

- Create a method that takes in a Binary Tree root as its argument and determines if it is balanced based on the depth of the two subrees.
### Big O

- The time efficiency of this algorithm is O(n) as it is a full tree traversal.

- The space efficiency of this algorithm is O(1) as we are not adding any additional memory.

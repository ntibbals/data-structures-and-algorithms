# Determine the Height and Level of a Binary Tree

### Challenge

- Create a method that takes in a Binary Tree as its argument and determines both the height and the level of a binary tree.
### Big O

- The time efficiency of this algorithm is O(n) as it is a full tree traversal.

- The space efficiency of this algorithm is O(1) as we are not adding any additional memoery.

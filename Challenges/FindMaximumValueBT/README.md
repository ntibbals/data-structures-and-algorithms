# Find Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

### Challenge

- Create a method that takes in a Binary Tree as its argument and determines the maximum value in the tree.
### Big O

- The time efficiency of this algorithm is O(n) as it is a full tree traversal.

- The space efficiency of this algorithm is O(h) which represents the height of the stack.

### Insight
ethod which Jason Hiskey verbally discussed with me and drew a white board visual utilizing a tree where we walked through the traversal.

# Breadth First Traversal

### Challenge

- Create a method called Breadth First that takes in a Binary Tree and traverses the tree using breadth first principles, printing out the values on screen. 
### Big O

- The time efficiency of this algorithm is O(n) as it is a full tree traversal.

- The space efficiency of this algorithm is O(W) representing the width of the tree as the largest the tree will ever be is the width of the tree.

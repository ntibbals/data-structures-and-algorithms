# Aniaml Shelter

# Challenge

- Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.

# Big O

- The both the time and space efficiency of Enqueue(value) is O(1) as it will always add a value to the end of the queue.

- The time efficiency of Dequeue is O(n). The algorithm will traverse the length of the queue in order to identify the proper node to dequeue.

# Insights

- I had a difficult time determining how to attached a "dog" or "cat" type onto a node. I believe an alternative solution would be to create an entirely new node class which takes in a Type of dog or cat.

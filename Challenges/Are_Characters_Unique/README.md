# Determine if a given string has unique characters

### Challenge

- Create a method that takes in a string and returns true if all characters are unique, false if a duplicate character is found.

### Big O

- The time efficiency of this algorithm is O(n^2) due to the nested for loop traversing through the array at most twice.

- The space efficiency of this algorithm is O(n) as we are instantiating a new array.

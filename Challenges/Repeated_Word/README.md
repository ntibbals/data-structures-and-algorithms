# Repeated Word

## Challenge
- Write a method that accepts a lengthy string as a paramenter. Without utilizing any of the built in library methods, return the first word to occur more than once in the provided string.

## Approach and Efficiency
- The time efficiency of this method is O(n) because at most, it will go through the entirety of the array.
- - The space efficiency of this method is O(n) as it holds the values in a new array and hash table.

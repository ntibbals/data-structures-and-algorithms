# Fizz Buzz Tree

### Challenge

- Create a method called FizzBuzzTree which takes in a tree as an argument. Utilize the Fizz Buzz logic to determine if each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both and change value of each node.

### Big O

- The time efficiency of this algorithm is O(n) as it is a full tree traversal.

- The space efficiency of this algorithm is O(1) as nothing is being added, just altered.

### Insight

- I've needed to refactored my code from over the weekend to better handled objects and generics in order to deal with the additional value types.

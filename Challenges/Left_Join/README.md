# Left Join

## Challenge
- Write a method that accepts a right and a left hash table. If the left key matches the right key, output the joined key and values. If the left key does not match the key, output the left key and value along with NULL.

## Approach and Efficiency
- The time efficiency of this method is O(n) because the method will touch every value in each hash table.
- The space efficiency of this method is O(n). This is because we are instantiating a new list to hold the collected values.
